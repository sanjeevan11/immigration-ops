## 🔑 KEY DIFFERENCES (OLD vs NEW)

### ❌ OLD (Broken):
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
<script src="js/api.js"></script>
```
Result: Files not found (404 errors)

### ✅ NEW (Fixed):
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/style.css">
<script src="./js/api.js"></script>
```
Result: Files load correctly! ✓

**That's the whole fix!** The `./` prefix tells GitHub Pages where to find files.
